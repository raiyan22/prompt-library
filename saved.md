### explain a feature in the project
explain it like a senior dev asked me and i am a junior dev i need to explain it tohim clearly in one paragraph


### scan current state 
before i implement anything i want yo to inspect the current state of the files so that you can implement the feature without messing it all up. so tell me which are the files you need to inspect in this regard?


###
can you identify the main features of this project? after that i will tell you to implement a specific feature

###


### 
tell me which files you need to inspect here and i will give

###
okay can you tell how can i achieve role based user thing in this app? specifically, now any user can create tags but i want that only users with a specific role will be able to create tags and regular blog users can use that then. but what if they need to create new tags? how does the users with specific roles know that a regular user is willing to create a new tag? give ideas how to implement this. concise plan first then after acknowledging you will implement step by step


### 
if you need to see any other additional files, let me know (like users or maybe auth etc.)


###
before i implement all of this, can you give a prompt with the context included about the current state of the app and also what feature needs to be implemented (that we discussed) in such a way so that i can use this prompt given by you to implement it after dinner?
